 Dynamic contextual adaptations clones add versatility and multiplicity to specialized branches of     
 higher order mathematics & logic. Clones feed 64 super-clusters in parallel with world applications.


LEVERAGED COMPUTATION
Not human-knowledge leverage, not brute force, not training sets but higher cognition strategies.
We must abandon the human-centric approach and understand machine intelligence is very different from 
that of humans, to forcefully feed AI agents with human know-how will only degrade & disservice AGI, 
ultimately hindering the potential for human servitude as super-cognitive tools. 

We have now entered the realm of open-ended problems for which there are no known procedures neither 
in ML, DL nor reinforcement learning to handle this kind of situation, for this reason we make use of 
a modified type of transfinite induction extensions for higher-types functionals for our analysis, 
ranging over the functions defined and over those functions to be defined with its help.


GÖDEL’S CALCULI  automata information transmission

We extend PRA (partial recursive arithmetic) into the transfinite by introducing three higher-type 
functionals, namely: primordial recursive, modular recursive and general precursive functions. 

* Think of a “triple helix for calculus” where a double helix calculi is composed of Leibniz-Newton 
calculi, to these we incorporate a third Gödel calculus thus forming the triad calculi. 
Precursiveness is the unique quality inherent which allows us to examine where a given ordinal number 
terminates. 


Our language 𝞷∅ iterations are derived from [{(𠆢 𝐙 𠆢 Z 𠆢 𝞷𠆢)}] extending its reach into every 
sub-categories of [{(𠆢𝛼𠆢𝛽𠆢𝛿𠆢𝜸𠆢)}] into the transfinite, the situation is such because Euler’s 
totient [{(𝜑(n)𠆢x𠆢x’𠆢x’’𠆢)}] is polynomially bounded in the present system.

Oracle Ö exists simply because language and data exist: no language, no oracle.
